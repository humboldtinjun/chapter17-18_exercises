""" Exercise 17.12.1: Ask a Virtual Assistant

    "When it goes well, object-oriented programming can make programs more readable, testable, and reusable. But it can also make programs complicated and hard to maintain. As a result, OOP is a topic of controversy â€“ some people love it, and some people donâ€™t.

    To learn more about the topic, ask a virtual assistant:

    What are some pros and cons of object-oriented programming?
         âœ… Pros:

    Reusable code

    Easier to organize complex programs

    Encapsulation (hide details inside classes)

âœ… Cons:

    Can be harder to read/debug

    Overengineering (making things too complicated)

    Inheritance chains can be confusing




        What does it mean when people say 'favor composition over inheritance'?
           Use objects inside other objects (has-a) instead of subclassing (is-a) â†’ 
           makes code more flexible and less tightly coupled.

        What is the Liskov substitution principle?
           If class B inherits from class A,
ðŸ‘‰ you should be able to use B anywhere A is expected, without breaking the program.

        Is Python an object-oriented language?
             Yes.
ðŸ‘‰ Everything in Python is an object, and it supports classes, inheritance, etc.
        What are the requirements for a set to be totally ordered?
            Every pair of elements must be comparable
âœ… Comparisons must be consistent (no contradictions)""""
